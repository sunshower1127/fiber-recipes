This is a cookbook recipe for setting up Fiber backend and Memgraph database. ðŸš€

## Prerequisites

Go is an obvious prerequisite. Make sure it is installed and configured properly.

After that you need two Go packages: Fiber and Neo4j driver for Go. You can install them with the following commands:

```
go get -u github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2
go get github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/v5
```

## Run Memgraph

The easiest way to run Memgraph is to use Docker.
Once docker is installed on your machine, you can run Memgraph with the following command:

```
docker run â€“name memgraph -it -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 -p 3000:3000 -v mg_lib:/var/lib/memgraph memgraph/memgraph-platform
```

## Run the recipe

After you have installed all the prerequisites, you can run the recipe with the following command:

```
cd memgraph
go run ./main.go
```

This will do the following:

1. Connect Fiber backend to Memgraph database
2. Generate mock data to populate the database
3. Define two request handlers: one for getting the graph and one for getting developer nodes

## Test the recipe

Once Fiber app is running, you can test the recipe by sending a GET request to the following endpoints:

```
http://localhost:3000/graph
http://localhost:3000/developer/Andy
```
