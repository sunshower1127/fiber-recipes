This example demonstrates how to deploy a Go Fiber application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

## Description

This project provides a starting point for deploying a Go Fiber application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. It includes necessary configuration files and scripts to build and deploy the application.

## Requirements

- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- [Elastic Beanstalk CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) 1.18 or higher
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gofiber/recipes.git
   cd recipes/aws-eb
   ```

2. Initialize Elastic Beanstalk:

   ```bash
   eb init
   ```

3. Create an Elastic Beanstalk environment:

   ```bash
   eb create
   ```

4. Deploy the application:
   ```bash
   eb deploy
   ```

## Build Process

The build process is defined in the `Buildfile` and `build.sh` scripts.

- `Buildfile`:

  ```ruby
  make: ./build.sh
  ```

- `build.sh`:

  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash -xe
  # Get dependencies
  go get -u github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2

  # Build the binary
  go build -o application application.go

  # Modify permissions to make the binary executable.
  chmod +x application
  ```

## Application Code

The main application code is in `application.go`:

```go
package main

import (
    "log"
    "os"

    "github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2"
)

func main() {
    // Initialize the application
    app := fiber.New()

    // Hello, World!
    app.Get("/", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
        return c.SendString("Hello, World!")
    })

    // Listen and Serve on 0.0.0.0:$PORT
    port := os.Getenv("PORT")
    if port == "" {
        port = "5000"
    }

    log.Fatal(app.Listen(":" + port))
}
```

## .gitignore

The `.gitignore` file includes configurations to ignore Elastic Beanstalk specific files:

```plaintext
# Elastic Beanstalk Files
.elasticbeanstalk/*
!.elasticbeanstalk/*.cfg.yml
!.elasticbeanstalk/*.global.yml
```

## Conclusion

This example provides a basic setup for deploying a Go Fiber application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. It can be extended and customized further to fit the needs of more complex applications.
