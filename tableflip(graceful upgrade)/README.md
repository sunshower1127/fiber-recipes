This example demonstrates how to use [tableflip](https://github.com/cloudflare/tableflip) for graceful upgrades in a Go application.

## What is Tableflip?

Tableflip is a library that allows you to update the running code and/or configuration of a network service without disrupting existing connections. It achieves this by starting a new process, transferring clients to it, and then exiting the old process.

### Goals of Tableflip

- No old code keeps running after a successful upgrade.
- The new process has a grace period for initialization.
- Crashing during initialization is acceptable.
- Only a single upgrade is ever run in parallel.
- Tableflip works on Linux and macOS.

## Steps

1. **Build v0.0.1 Demo:**

   ```bash
   go build -o demo main.go
   ```

2. **Run the Demo and Create a GET Request to `127.0.0.1:8080/version`:**

   ```bash
   [PID: 123] v0.0.1
   ```

3. **Prepare a New Version:**

- Change the `main.go` to update the version to "v0.0.2".
- Rebuild the demo:
  ```bash
  go build -o demo main.go
  ```

4. **Kill the Old Process:**

   ```bash
   kill -s HUP "PID"
   ```

5. **Create the Request to the Version API Again:**
   ```bash
   [PID: 123] v0.0.2
   ```

The client is completely immune to server upgrades and reboots, and our application updates gracefully!
